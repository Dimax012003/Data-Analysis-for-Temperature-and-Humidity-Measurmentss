# Data-Analysis-for-Temperature-and-Humidity-Measurmentss
This project uses data for temperature,humidity measurements and flame detection. 
In consists of an arduino project using a dht11,an rgb led for temperature variations, a ky026 flame sensor,a buzzer in case a temperature increases to higher a levels and for flame detection,a potensiometer for volume control,a rotary encoder to set up the real time for the project.
The sensors are sending data to serial port through witch the python file reads this data and implements data analysis by creating graphs for the temperature the humidity and flame detection in real time.
Also provides statistics from the .csv file for the maximum and the minimum temperature and humidity measures.
